# stocks-analysis
# Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to refactor a VBA code for Steve in order to collect and analyze the real stock market data in the year 2017 and 2018 and to determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing. It is also to determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. We also made the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.

# Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
The results show that 2017 was a good year for Steve’s portfolio, whilst 2018 the market performed poorly the market. The stock analysis outputs for 2017 and 2018 are the same as dataset example provided and the images saved for 2017 and 2018 has the pop-up messages showing elapsed run time for the refactored code as VBA_Challenge_2017.png and VBA_Challenge_2018.png. 

# Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
# What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantages of the code are it runs extremely fast allowing Steve to make quick trades to maximize his positions in the market and also that logical errors easily appear in well structure code that contains nested conditionals and loops. The disadvantages are the complex unstructured code is usually best to split in several functions and refactoring process can affect the testing outcomes. It also cannot predetermine what the future of the market will look like, only the historical values. However, we can look at the overall performance within specific timeframes using the historical values. Thus, it will allow Steve to analyze and predetermine potential movements of stocks within a specific timeframe.

# How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
Refactoring helps make our code cleaner and more organized including design and software improvement, debugging, and faster programming. It may also benefit other users who view the analysises because it becomes easier to read, as it is more concise and straightforward. However, we do not always have the luxury to refactor our code due to disadvantages ranging from having applications that are too large to not having the proper test cases for the existing codes, which may ultimately pose some risk if we try to refactor our code.
